# Your Life into Epochs
First, you will be asked to divide your life into seven different time periods or “epochs.” These epochs can be as short or as long as you want, depending on how much you want to write about. One epoch might be "Grade School", for example, while a later epoch could be "First Year University".

If you have many significant experiences from a particular period of time, that period deserves to have its own epoch.

Next, you will be asked to identify the significant experiences that characterized each of the seven epochs. You can write about as few or as many experiences as you like for each epoch. Finally, you will be asked to describe how each of these experiences has shaped who you are today.

You can write as much as you want. People have written thousands of words while completing this exercise. Other people have written less.
