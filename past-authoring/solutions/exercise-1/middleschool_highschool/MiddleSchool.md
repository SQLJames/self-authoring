# Middle School
When we got into middle school we were becoming more aware of the girls around us, but we didn't really know how to react. After all we were just stupid boys who played video games. I remember mark's first "girlfriend", Arlene Imbert. Now when I say girlfriend I don't mean that they were dating , I mean that they were teased about being boyfriend and girlfriend by the kids in our grade even though they had only kissed. However, that was a HUGE deal in 7th grade. 

Now as you can imagine, since like 4th grade we didnt eat the best and we were mostly playing video games inside drinking soda. I was a pretty heavy kid. This was something that I got teased about, quite a bit. However there was not much that I could about that at this point in time. I just instead joined chorus having to take an elective and got placed into the baraton
