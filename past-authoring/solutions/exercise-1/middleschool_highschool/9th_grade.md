# 9th grade 
This was a huge year for me in the 7-8 grade i was in chorus where they trained me to become a baritone. I joined the a capella chorus at american heritage and started weightlifting with the football coach. The first few months in school I lost probably 40 lbs and started to put on muscle, which got me noticed by alot of the girls in my grade. 

Come valentines day almost towards the end of the year, I decided to bring roses to all the girls that I liked, Handing out roses to Savannah, Ally (one of Savannah's friends), Lainie, Nicole G and a few others. Man I later found out that alot of them were super pissed by this move. Though I did become closer to alot of them I chose Lainie, I think at some point I was attracted to her because she was smart and came from a good family. However, the problem always was that we broke up every summer because she would hang out with her Ex honestly we weren't a good couple for either of us but the sex was pretty crazy. 

During this time we started to hang out at the oasis at sawgrass, this was the place to be back in those years as it had just opened up. Our parents would drop us off around 5-6 pm on a Saturday and we would stay there probably till 10-11 getting food and movies and walking around the sawgrass mall. Most of the time though we would end up sneaking off somewhere to have sex or fool around somewhere. 
The majority of the time it was at the parking garage in the back or this outcove in the back behind the target. No cars would drive by and we could just go at it. 

Honestly, that was probably more of me corrupting her but she was definitely into it. I remember there was one time after we first started dating that her parents had me over to their house and we stayed up stairs with the door open and she moved my hand into her underwear while we were watching a movie. 

We always used to hang out on the side of the 3000 building (the theater and performing arts building) for lunch just because it was one of the few places with shade and we had enough seating by using the stairs. This was also great because we all came out from the chorus room right to the hangout spot, except for Brennan he came from the 2000 Building, which was the field house. 

This was the year I got my first cell phone, a nokia , which we always used to drop off the building because they were indestructable. I even at one point pulled out the plastic cover and replaced it with a peice of plastic from a container and that worked even better. 
 
Anyways, We also traveled to New york this year in March, this was super fun because it was the first time alot of the kids got to see snow and also this was the first time we would perform at carnegie hall. While it was super strict
