## John Clark
While it wouldn't be for awhile in the 6th grade. John was kinda the odd ball out, he didn't have many friends and Mark and Brennan were opposed to making friends with him. However, we bonded while playing the Yugioh card game. I did only spend one day over at his house and we never really hung out much until highschool when we were doing theater work together. I only mention him here because he became a large portion of my interactions in highschool alot with my dating life when I went into college.
