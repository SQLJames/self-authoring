# Elementary
While I don't remember much from these times, I remember having a family that would help me celebrate. And that I made life time long friends along the way. In first grade, my parents held me back one year to make sure that I wasn't the youngest in the grade. I also started a new school, transfering from a school called Sunny land. They wanted me to have the best opportunities avaialble. 

I never really got into fights or arguments with other people, I really tried not to ruffle that many feathers. All I wanted to do at that school was to fit in and try my best, however that was not always the case in my highschool years.
